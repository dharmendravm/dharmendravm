Hi, I'm Dharmendra Verma 👋
==========================

MERN Stack Developer

I build real-world, production-style web applications using the MERN stack.
My focus is on backend logic, REST API design, authentication, and writing
clean, maintainable React user interfaces.

I like working on complete application flows — from frontend UI to backend
services and database design.
